1. User Permissions / Roles
	•	Add more granular permissions for different types of users (e.g., admins, content editors, viewers).
	•	Allow repo owners to manage user access to specific repositories or parts of the configuration files.

2. File History / Version Control
	•	Implement a file history viewer so users can see previous versions of the configuration.yml file and roll back changes if necessary.
	•	Add a diff viewer to highlight changes between different versions of the file before and after editing.

3. Error Handling and Notifications
	•	Set up error alerts or a notification system (e.g., email, Slack) to inform users and admins about failed commits, PRs, or merge conflicts.
	•	Display real-time feedback to users on syntax errors in YAML or conflicts.

4. Analytics and Reporting
	•	Add analytics features that show changes over time in content or SEO, with reports on when files were last edited, who made changes, etc.
	•	Provide some insights into SEO performance or trends based on the changes users are making.

5. Approval Workflow
	•	Introduce an approval system where changes pushed to the repository require review by one or more team members before merging.
	•	Add an audit log for tracking who made changes and when, especially if the platform is used by teams.

6. Integration with Other Platforms
	•	If relevant, integrate with other tools like Google Search Console, Analytics, or third-party SEO tools to pull in data directly into the platform, 
	so users can optimise their pages with data-driven insights.

7. User Dashboard / Profile
	•	Create a user dashboard where users can view all their active repositories, track ongoing PRs, and see their editing history.
	•	Allow users to update their profile, including email preferences or integration settings.

8. Multi-Repo Management
	•	If users manage multiple repositories, build an aggregated view where they can manage and edit files across different repos more easily.
	•	Provide bulk editing options where users can update certain settings across multiple repositories at once.

12. When saving a change to a file - make a popup that allows them to choose which branch to save to - recommend a "review" branch
this will stop people from aimlessly commiting

13. "For other collaborators, show the editable role dropdown" - only the repo owner should be able to change anyones roles. 
collaborators shouldnt be able to change their own roles
